given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done .
fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment .
it 's one heck of a character study -- not of hearst or davies but of the unique relationship between them .
if you 're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a.i. , you 'll probably like rollerball .
determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult .
one of the smartest takes on singles culture i 've seen in a long time .
a smart , witty follow-up .
two hours fly by -- opera 's a pleasure when you do n't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated .
the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels .
a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) .
if it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .
remember the kind of movie we were hoping `` ecks vs. sever '' or `` xxx '' was going to be ?
every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .
prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment .
the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale .
burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .
scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .
woody allen 's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz .
the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .
entertains by providing good , lively company .
it 's a coming-of-age story we 've all seen bits of in other films -- but it 's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity .
jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory .
a giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of oscar-winners : susan sarandon and goldie hawn .
and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .
the script kicks in , and mr. hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow .
... the movie is just a plain old monster .
( serry ) wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition .
this is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you 're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other .
what is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this imposter .
it 's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it 's brilliant .
and when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem .
for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution .
because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .
does paint some memorable images ... , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .
a gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life .
if the first men in black was money , the second is small change .
byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama .
i 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back !
it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
it 's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way .
for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .
hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .
if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it 's john turturro , who 's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish .
the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
generally , clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes .
prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this english trifle .
that 's pure pr hype .
a breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom , while offering exceptionally well-detailed characters .
the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .
a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line .
at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
or emptying rat traps .
it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker 's motherland .
i 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .
although huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun .
the film 's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone .
travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment .
though catch me if you can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .
there 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .
but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?
my thoughts were focused on the characters .
one from the heart .
as a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a triumph , however , it is not .
while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .
sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn .
just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever .
davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .
an exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , minority report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order
i got a headache watching this meaningless downer .
if you dig on david mamet 's mind tricks ... rent this movie and enjoy !
